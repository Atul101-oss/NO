Certainly! To solve a constrained optimization problem, you can use optimization libraries available in Python. One commonly used library is SciPy. Below is an example of a Python program using SciPy to solve a simple constrained optimization problem:

python
Copy code
from scipy.optimize import minimize

# Define the objective function
def objective_function(x):
    return x[0]**2 + 4 * x[1]**2 - 2 * x[0] * x[1] - 4 * x[0]

# Define the constraints
constraints = (
    {'type': 'ineq', 'fun': lambda x: x[0] + x[1] - 3},
    {'type': 'ineq', 'fun': lambda x: -x[0] - x[1] + 0.5}
)

# Define the initial guess
initial_guess = [0, 0]

# Solve the constrained optimization problem
result = minimize(objective_function, initial_guess, constraints=constraints)

# Display the results
print("Optimal Solution:")
print(f"x: {result.x[0]}")
print(f"y: {result.x[1]}")
print(f"Optimal Value: {result.fun}")
In this example, we are solving the following constrained optimization problem:

The minimize function from SciPy is used, and the constraints are specified as a list of dictionaries with the 'type' set to 'ineq' (inequality constraints). You can modify the objective function, constraints, and initial guess based on your specific problem.

Make sure you have SciPy installed (pip install scipy) before running the code. Adjust the constraints and the objective function based on your particular optimization problem.
